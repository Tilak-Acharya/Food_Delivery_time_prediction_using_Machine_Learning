# Food_Delivery_time_prediction_using_Machine_Learning

Using Machine learning in python to predict the food delivery time in real-time. We need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, we need to find relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the past for the same distance.

So, for this task, we need a dataset containing data about the time taken by delivery partners to deliver food from the restaurant to the delivery location.
